      SUBROUTINE WOFZ (XI, YI, U, V, FLAG)
!C
!C  GIVEN A COMPLEX NUMBER Z = (XI,YI), THIS SUBROUTINE COMPUTES
!C  THE VALUE OF THE FADDEEVA-FUNCTION W(Z) = EXP(-Z**2)*ERFC(-I*Z),
!C  WHERE ERFC IS THE COMPLEX COMPLEMENTARY ERROR-FUNCTION AND I
!C  MEANS SQRT(-1).
!C  THE ACCURACY OF THE ALGORITHM FOR Z IN THE 1ST AND 2ND QUADRANT
!C  IS 14 SIGNIFICANT DIGITS; IN THE 3RD AND 4TH IT IS 13 SIGNIFICANT
!C  DIGITS OUTSIDE A CIRCULAR REGION WITH RADIUS 0.126 AROUND A ZERO

!C  THE CODE CONTAINS A FEW COMPILER-DEPENDENT PARAMETERS :
