NHDS solves the linear hot-plasma dispersion relation based on the Vlasov-Maxwell set of
equations.

NHDS has the following requirements:

    make
    Fortran 90 compiler
    HDF5 (although it can now also be compiled without HDF5)

Compile the code by executing

    ./configure                                  (if you do not want to use HDF5 capabilities)
    ./configure --with-hdf5=/path/to/hdf5        (this could be: "/usr/local/hdf5" on a Mac)

    make

in the main directory. Then run NHDS with

    ./src/NHDS <input_file.in>

It is possible to install NHDS in the main binary directory through

    sudo make install

The plasma and numerical parameters are set in the file <input_file.in>.
The code requires only the folder src in the main directory.
